This is code I wrote to drive our robot (https://nickdegrasse.wixsite.com/nicholasdegrasse/stroke-rehabilitaition-robot) using a PID controller. 

This uses two DC motors, a motor shield, battery+Boost converter, 5 analog IR sensors, and an Arduino Pro Mini to follow a line a physician draws. It will later be used
in conjunction with other elements to guide a stroke victim through reach exercises.
