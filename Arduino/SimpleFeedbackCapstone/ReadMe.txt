This code will update two i2c connected OLED screens, a buzzer, and LED to show possible feedback our robot will have when stroke patients are able to successfully 
complete a trial on their reach exercises.

This code was used as a prop when competing on the Holloman health challenge (https://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/entrepreneurship-competitions/uw-health-innovation-challenge/), to demonstrate what our device could look like 
in its final form. More information on the project can be found here: https://nickdegrasse.wixsite.com/nicholasdegrasse/stroke-rehabilitaition-robot
